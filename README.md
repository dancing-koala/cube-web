#Cube-Web
A simple moving randomly cobweb made of cubes and lines with Three.js.
The cubes and lines are produced using a particle engine inspired from
[this one](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Particle-Engine.html).


##TODO
* Limit cubes movements to a maximum distance from the center;
* Draw lines only when the cubes are not too distant;
* Smoother cubes movements;
* Interaction with the user (other than orbit controls);
* Death and rebirth for cubes and lines;
* Maybe add a very small camera bobbing effect;
* Add a pusle effect, just for fun;
